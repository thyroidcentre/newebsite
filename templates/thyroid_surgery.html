                    <p>Thyroid surgery is advised in patients with the following problems
                        <br>
                        1 . Thyroid nodule where the FNAC (needle test) shows cancer (Bethesda 6) or suspicious of
                        cancer (Bethesda 5).
                        <br>
                        2 . Thyroid nodule where the FNAC shows follicular neoplasm (Bethesda 4) or atypia of
                        undetermined significance (Bethesda 3).
                        <br>
                        3 . Large thyroid nodule more than 4cm in size, or a large swelling compressing the windpipe or
                        food pipe
                        <br>
                        4 . Large thyroid swelling which is cosmetically disfiguring
                        <br>
                        5 . Hyperthyroidism uncontrolled by medication or radioactive iodine, or in patients where these
                        treatments produce side effects.
                        <br>
                        6 . Retrosternal goitres (swellings extending into the chest).

                    <p>
                        You will be given general anaesthesia to make you fall asleep and minimise pain. Thyroid surgery
                        is then performed via a 4-6cm incision in the front of the neck. Incision is placed over the
                        skin fold to minimize the scar. The thyroid gland is then carefully dissected out and removed.
                        The surgeon should take care to identify and preserve adjacent structures like the parathyroid
                        glands (maintain calcium levels in the blood) and the recurrent laryngeal nerves (voice nerves).

                        What are the risks associated with thyroid surgery?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Thyroid surgery is generally a safe surgery with minimal complication rates. Risk of
                        complications also depends on the surgeons skill and experience. Some complications which may
                        occur are bleeding (1 to 2%), infection (rare), hoarseness of voice (1 to 3%), low calcium
                        levels.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>What will my scar look like after surgery?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Slight bruising or swelling may be seen surrounding the scar immediately after surgery. The scar
                        will then turn pink and harden over the next few weeks as the incision heals. The scar is at its
                        thickest at 3 to 4 weeks, and gradually becomes smaller and less visible over the next 3 months.
                        Complete healing may take up to 6 to 8 months. Try to avoid any undue strain on your neck for at
                        least 2 weeks following surgery. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The surgeon will make the incision along a natural skin crease and also make the incision as
                        small as possible in order to camouflage the scar. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A large proportion of patients, do not have a noticeable scar 6-8 months after surgery. </p>

                    <p>If you have a single nodule we do nodulectomy/hemithyroidectomy and send it for frozen biopsy
                        (intra-operative quick biopsy). This report will come in 20 minutes and if it is benign
                        (non-cancerous) the rest of the thyroid will be left behind. If it comes as cancerous then the
                        opposite lobe of the thyroid is also removed to facilitate further treatment.</p>

                    <p>We will check your thyroid hormone levels 4 weeks after the surgery. In 80-90% of patients the
                        opposite lobe will compensate the thyroid function. The remaining 10-20% may need thyroid
                        medicine supplementation. But if you were taking thyroid medicine (thyroxine) before surgery,
                        you will have to continue the medications.</p>

                    <p>If your entire thyroid is removed, you will have to take lifelong thyroid (thyroxine)
                        medications. Thyroxine is normally produced by the thyroid gland. These medications have no side
                        effects and it will totally take care of the function of thyroid gland.</p>

                    <p>This tablet has to be taken in the fasting state soon after you get up. Give a minimum gap of

                    <p>There is no adverse effect to missing one dose of this medication. Please take two tablets
                        together whenever you remember that you missed a dose. Fortunately, the thyroxine hormone has a
                        half life of 7 days and will act till seven days. But make it a habit to take the tablet, as the
                        first thing you do as soon as you get up.</p>

                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>We check parathyroid hormone levels after total thyroidectomy and if the parathyroid hormone

                    <p>A parathyroid hormone level of &lt;15pg/ml will mean that parathyroid function is less than

                    <p>An expert thyroid surgeon is one who performs at least 100 thyroidectomies per year. The rate of

                    <h3>When will the patient be admitted?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Patient can come in morning at 8am on the day of surgery to the admission block in Apollo Health
                        City Jubilee Hills for admission.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>For how long does the patient have to stay in the hospital after surgery?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Usually the patient will be discharged in 1 or 2 days. Occasionally the calcium levels may become
                        very low after surgery, and some patients may need to stay in hospital for 3 to 4 days in order
                        to normalise calcium levels.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>When can I talk and eat after thyroid surgery?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Yes, you can talk and eat on the same day after your surgery. There is no restriction on your
                        diet or voice.</p>

                    <h3>What is scarless thyroidectomy?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>It is a technique in which the thyroid gland is removed through a small incision in the lower
                        lip. The gland is dissected out using micro-surgical instruments (endoscopes). This incision
                        completely heals after 3 months with no visible scar.</p>
