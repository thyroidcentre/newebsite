                    <p>The parathyroid glands are small, 3-4mm glands located behind the thyroid gland. They are four in
                        number. They play an important role in maintaining normal calcium levels in the body. A tumour
                        or enlargement of the parathyroid glands can cause increased calcium levels in the body. </p>

                        <p>It is a condition in which your blood calcium levels are elevated, due to an increase in
                            parathyroid hormone levels. This can weaken your bones and damage your kidneys. Increased
                            blood calcium levels can cause problems related to digestion and nervous system function as

                        <p>
                            The commonest cause is a tumour (enlarged gland) affecting one of your parathyroid glands.
                            <br>
                            In around 10-15% of patients all the parathyroid glands or rarely two or more may be
                            enlarged.

                            Primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed by the presence of increased calcium, in the
                            presence of increased parathyroid hormone levels. Other tests such as a 24 hour urinary
                            calcium and bone mineral density are done to confirm the presence of the disorder.

                        <p>If your serum calcium is more than 10.6mg/dL with elevated Parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, a
                            diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is likely. Tests which are then done to confirm the
                            diagnosis include urinary calcium measurements, ultrasound scan of the neck and technetium
                            sestamibi uptake scan.</p>

                        <p>The tumour in the parathyroid gland produces excessive parathyroid hormones and this hormone
                            in turn acts on the bones and weakens it by taking out calcium from it , and this excessive
                            calcium in the blood is excreted through the kidneys. But the calcium load becomes so much
                            that there can be deposition of calcium in the kidneys and causes kidney stones. Sometimes
                            it gets deposited in the pancreas and causes severe pain abdomen (pancreatitis). This excess
                            calcium can act on your brain and cause mood changes, memory loss and irritability.</p>
                        <p>Due to the continuous removal of the calcium from the bones, they become weak and lead to
                            fractures, bony pains, weakness and bone tumours.</p>

                            glands. For this scan the patient is first positioned in a specific way to minimize
                            interference. A specified amount of contrast is then given and images are acquired in three
                            phases – pre contrast , arterial and venous. The timing of these phases helps to
                            differentiate parathyroid tissue from other surrounding structures.</p>

                        <div class="space18"></div>
                        <p>It is one of the most challenging aspects of parathyroid surgery. It is an operation to treat
                            hyperparathyroidism after the first operation has failed to achieve cure. The risks of redo
                            surgery are higher than for the original surgery, and it should be performed only by an
                            expert surgeon.</p>
                        <p>Some of the reasons for a failed parathyroid surgery are a missed adenoma, surgeon removing
                            only one gland when the disease actually affects all 4 glands (hyperplasia), and ectopic
                            location of the abnormal parathyroid such as inside the chest or behind the trachea</p>

                        <p>If your calcium and PTH have not changed after your surgery it is called persistent

                        <p>
                            1 . Failure to identify or remove the parathyroid adenoma.

                            2 . Presence of more than one tumour. Such a tumour could also be present in unusual
                            locations, such as in the chest.
                            <br>

                            4 . In some patients hyperparathyroidism can reappear several years after successful

                        Use of intraoperative PTH and frozen section during repeat surgery(intraoperative quick biopsy
                        report).
                        <p>The first thing to do is to reconfirm the diagnosis. We need to assess whether the patient
                            has single parathyroid gland disease or multiple parathyroid gland disease.We also need to
                            rule out a mild inherited condition called Benign familiar hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
                            (BFHH).</p>
                        <p>After confirming the disease by blood and urine tests the following steps can be taken
                            <br>
                            Ultrasound of the neck

                            <br>
                            2 . Review the biopsy report of the first surgery by an experienced pathologist (slide and
                            block review)
                            <br>
                            3 . Review the previous operation details if possible, with a discussion of the problems
                            encountered during initial surgery.
                            <br>
                            4 . To do a 4D CT scan of the neck
                            <br>
                            5 . Use of intraoperative PTH and frozen section during repeat surgery(intraoperative quick

                            surgeon will re-send parathyroid hormone levels to confirm the decrease in PTH levels before
                            closing the operation.</p>

                        <p>Parathyroidectomy is a safe surgery and complications are rare. Some of the problems which
                            are occasionally seen are
                            <br>
                            1 . Failure to achieve normal calcium levels can happen in 1-5% of patients, and depends on
                            surgeon experience as well as the type of parathyroid problem
                            <br>
                            2 . Postoperative hypocalcemia(low calcium levels)- This can be due to suppression of the
                            normal parathyroid glands by the tumour, or occasionally due to damage to the parathyroid
                            glands during four gland exploration. The lowest calcium level is seen at 24- 48 hours after
                            surgery, so patients are carefully monitored for any symptoms or signs.
                            <br>
                            3 . Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury – It is a nerve injury which causes voice change. It is
                            very rare in the hands of experienced surgeons and is seen in less than 1% of cases.
