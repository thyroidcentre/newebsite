                    <h2>Thyroid Cancer</h2>
                    <div class="space16"></div>
                    <p>Thyroid cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer. The four main types of thyroid cancer
                        are
                        <br>
                        1 . Papillary cancer
                        <br>
                        2 . Follicular cancer
                        <br>
                        3 . Medullary cancer
                        <br>
                        4 . Anaplastic thyroid cancer
                    </p>

                    <h3>What are the symptoms of thyroid cancer?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Thyroid cancer commonly presents as a swelling in front of the neck that does not cause any other
                        symptoms. The lump may be noticed by your physician during a routine hospital visit for another
                        illness. In some cases, the lump may be large enough to cause symptoms by pressing on adjacent
                        structures in the neck. These patients can have symptoms of hoarsness of voice, difficulty in
                        swallowing, breathlessness or a vague discomfort in the throat. Pain is uncommon and seen in
                        thyroiditis and rare cancers, such as anaplastic.</p>
                    <div class="space48"></div>
                    <h3>How is thyroid cancer diagnosed?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Thyroid cancer is diagnosed based on the results of the ultrasound and FNAC (Fine Needle
                        Aspiration Cytology) examinations. Your doctor may also find certain features on physical
                        examination , which raise a possibility of thyroid cancer. Your doctor may note features,
                        suspicious for cancer on an ultrasound examination. FNAC (also called a needle test) can help
                        confirm the diagnosis of cancer. However in a number of patients, the FNAC can show results
                        which fall in between the benign and cancerous spectrum. In such patients, conformation of the
                        diagnosis can be done only after the lump is surgically removed and examined. </p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p><b>It is also important to remember that blood tests will not diagnose thyroid cancer. TSH test
                            which is commonly done to determine the function of the thyroid gland will be normal in most
                            patients with thyroid cancer.</b></p>

                        What are the types of thyroid cancer?
                    </h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p><b>Papillary thyroid cancer/ mixed papillary follicular thyroid cancer:</b>
                        <br>
                        It is the commonest type of thyroid cancer and constitutes about 85% of all thyroid cancers. It
                        grows very slowly and tends to spread to lymph nodes in the neck. However this form of cancer
                        has good prognosis and excellent response to treatment in a majority of patients
                    </p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p><b>Follicular thyroid cancer:</b><br>
                        It constitutes about 10% of all thyroid cancers and is usually seen in older age groups. It has
                        a tendency to spread to distant organs like the lungs or bones, through the blood stream.
                        Overall cure rate is good even though the disease is more aggressive than papillary
                        cancer.Treatment results depend on the size of the tumor and the extent of spread to distant
                        organs.
                    </p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p><b>Medullary thyroid cancer:</b>
                        It constitutes about 2 to 4% of cases of thyroid cancer. 25% of medullary thyroid cancers have
                        an inherited (familial) basis. Early detection is important for complete cure.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p><b>Anaplastic thyroid cancer:</b><br>
                        It is seen in 1-2% of patients. It is a fast growing tumor and one of the most aggressive
                        cancers which usually affects older patients. Treatment is least effective in this type of
                        cancer.
                    </p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>How are thyroid cancers treated?</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Treatment options for papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are similar. These two types of
                        cancer are together called as<b> differentiated thyroid cancer</b>. Prognosis in these patients
                        depends on tumour size, extent of spread and the age of the patient. Younger patients do better
                        than patients who are more than 55 years of age. Surgery and radioiodine therapy are the primary
                        modalities of treatment for these common types of thyroid cancer</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>Surgery</h3>
                    <p>Surgery is the first line of treatment for thyroid cancer. The type of surgery depends on the
                        size of the tumour and whether or not the tumour has invaded the surrounding tissues in the
                        neck. For very small cancers (< 1cm) with no surrounding spread, a simple lobectomy – removal of
                            the involved side of thyroid may be enough. However most patients require total
                            thyroidectomy – complete removal of the thyroid gland, as cancer cells are commonly found in
                            the opposite lobe of the thyroid as well. Lymph node involvement is commonly found, either
                            during initial evaluation or during the surgery. These lymph nodes can be removed at the
                            time of the initial surgery ( central or lateral compartment neck dissection) or later if
                            lymph node involvement develops later on. Patients need to take thyroid hormone
                            supplementation life long after a complete <a
                            href="{{ url_for('scarless_thyroidectomy') }}">thyroidectomy.</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Early stage thyroid cancer is completely cured by thyroid surgery alone. If the tumour is larger,
                        or has spread to adjacent areas or lymph nodes, your doctor will also advise radioiodine
                        treatment.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>Radioactive iodine therapy</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Thyroid cells have the ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream and concentrate it. A form
                        of radioactive iodine is therefore used to identify and destroy residual thyroid cancer cells
                        after surgery. Radioactive iodine (I-131) is given in the form of a liquid or a capsule. The
                        thyroid cancer cells take up almost all this iodine with very less reaching other organs in the
                        body. The radioactive iodine then destroys the cancer cell from within. Rarely in patients
                        getting higher doses of radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer metastasis, the iodine can affect
                        the salivary glands producing dry mouth.
                        Patients requiring radioactive iodine therapy, need to have higher levels of TSH before the
                        treatment. This helps improve the uptake of the iodine into thyroid tissue. To achieve this,
                        your doctor will advise you to stop your thyroid hormone pills 3-4weeks before the treatment.
                        You may develop symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, body ache and dry skin during this
                        period. An alternative way of increasing TSH levels, is by using injections of recombinant TSH.
                        If your doctor plans this method of treatment, you will receive 2 doses of recombinant TSH
                        (rhTSH) before the radioactive iodine dose.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>TSH suppressive therapy</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>All thyroid cancer patients need to take thyroid hormone replacement after their thyroid surgery.
                        The dose of thyroid hormone required depends on the type and extent of thyroid cancer. Patients
                        with low risk or early stage thyroid cancer may only require normal doses of thyroid hormone, to
                        keep their TSH levels in the normal range. Patients with moderate or higher risk thyroid cancer,
                        typically require higher doses of thyroid hormone in order to keep their TSH at low levels.
                        Keeping the TSH at a low level will help in preventing regrowth of the tumour.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>Follow-up of thyroid cancer</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Regular check-ups are essential for all thyroid cancer patients. Follow-up is usually at 3 to 6
                        monthly intervals. Your doctor will evaluate you for either recurrence of the tumour, or for
                        residual tumour remaining after the initial treatment. These visits include a careful physical
                        examination, blood tests as well as necessary imaging. The thyroglobulin test is an important
                        blood test, which is repeated at least once every year. This is a protein produced by thyroid
                        cells and gives an early clue towards the presence of thyroid cancer cells in the body. An
                        ultrasound of the neck is also usually done to look for tumour or lymph nodes in the neck. Your
                        doctor may also advise a whole body iodine scan, in order to look for the presence of thyroid
                        cancer in the neck or at other distant sites.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>Medullary thyroid cancer</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>This is a rare tumour which arises from cells called the parafollicular c cells. These cells are
                        present within the thyroid gland and secrete a number of proteins. This cancer is attributed to
                        inherited genetic mutations in up to 25% of patients. Medullary thyroid cancer is usually
                        diagnosed when a patient presents with a nodule in the thyroid or enlarged lymph nodes in the
                        neck. This tumour spreads to the local lymph nodes earlier than the papillary and follicular
                        types of cancer.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Evaluation and management of this rare type of cancer requires an experienced team of doctors,
                        especially as this cancer may be associated with involvement of other organs of the body. These
                        patients need evaluation and treatment for associated conditions such as pheochromocytoma( a
                        tumour of the adrenal glands) and hyperparathyroidism. A genetic test may also be planned if
                        there is suspicion of inherited disease. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All patients with medullary thyroid cancer are treated surgically. The type of surgery depends on
                        the extent of disease, local spread and the general health of the patient. All patients will
                        require removal of the thyroid gland together with the lymph nodes of the central compartment of
                        the neck (called central neck dissection). The lymph nodes from the side of the neck may need to
                        be removed if found to be involved with the cancer( called lateral neck dissection).These
                        procedures require an expert thyroid surgeon as complete removal of diseased tissue needs to be
                        achieved, while at the same time concentrating on the integrity of surrounding structures such
                        as the parathyroids and recurrent laryngeal nerves. The aim of an expert surgeon will also
                        include maintaining a normal appearance of the neck, and keeping the scar as small as possible.
                    </p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>Follow-up</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Patients require regular follow up with clinical examination, chest X ray, ultrasounds and blood
                        tests. Blood tests are done to look for proteins produced by these cancer cells. Levels of
                        calcitonin and CEA(carcinoembryonic antigen) are checked every 3 to 6 months.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>Advanced disease</h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Advanced medullary thyroid cancer may extensively involve surrounding structures like the food
                        pipe(esophagus), wind pipe (trachea) and pharynx. Production of biologically active substances
                        by the tumour can cause symptoms like diarrhoea, flushing or breathlessness. Surgical resection
                        of this tumour by an experienced surgeon is required in these patients. Extensive disease which
                        has spread to distant organs requires treatment with chemotherapy or radionucleide therapy,
                        depending on the condition of the patient.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>

                        Prognosis
                    </h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>Patients with this rare cancer have lower cure rates than patients with papillary thyroid cancer.
                        However in patients with early stage medullary cancer, surgery results in complete cure. 10-year
                        survival rates are 90% when all the disease is confined to the thyroid gland, 70% when the
                        cancer has spread to cervical lymph nodes and 20% when the cancer is found in distant sites.</p>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <h3>
                        Anaplastic thyroid cancer
                    </h3>
                    <div class="space18"></div>
                    <p>This is the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer. It is rare and accounts for 1-2% of all
                        thyroid cancers. It usually affects people who are more than 65 years old. It commonly arises
                        within a thyroid nodule which may have existed for a long period of time. It has a tendency to
                        spread rapidly, and lymph node involvement is seen in 90% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
                        Surgery is done in patients who are diagnosed with an earlier stage of anaplastic thyroid
                        cancer. Patients with advanced cancer are treated with chemotherapy and external beam radiation.
